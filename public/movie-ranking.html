<h3>Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl</h3>
<p>This is the book that got me back into reading. I really think this is a book everyone should read at least once in their life.</p>
<h3>Babel by R.F. Kuang</h3>
<p>This is a brilliant book. I enjoyed every page. The story and the characters were so well thought out and incredibly engaging. I wish I could read this for the first time again.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</h3>
<p>It's very hard to describe this book. At its core, it is a book about two friends who make video games together, but the story is so much more. It has wonderful character development and does a beautiful job capturing what real life people would do.</p>
